## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Deep Learning Nanodegree! In this project, I have built a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, I have made important design decisions about the user experience for the app.  By completing this lab, I have understood the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. 

### Transfer Learning CNN Model
I used VGG-16 for the transfer learning:

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/shubham3063/Dog-Breed-Classifier.git
	```
	

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.
